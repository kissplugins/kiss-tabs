System instructions:
- Please use WP best practices for security and maintainability.
- Please do not refactor anything beyond the scope of the immediate tasks.
- Please do not change any labels.
- Please keep the TOC, increment the version number for each change, and add to the existing changelog within the main plugin file.
- Please try your best to adhere to DRY principles so we can re-use existing functions and not create new functions.
